# discord-bots-for-fun
Made a few discord bots, bajangle as a simple joke bot among friends that can send simple msgs, smug as a utility bot that can play youtube music with link inputs

The setup guide for actually getting your discord bot to a server was found here: https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/

The ffmpeg files are for the package to play the music in a voice channel.

Unzip the bz2 file to have a ffmpeg-4.1 folder to be used by the discord bots for playing music.
